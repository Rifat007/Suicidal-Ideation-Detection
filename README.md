# Suicidal-Ideation-Detection
Suicidal ideation refers to peoples' thoughts of committing suicide. Many factors, such as personal issues, social factors, negative life events, etc. are correlated to suicidal ideation. According to the report of WHO in 2020, 800,000 people died due to suicide every year. 

In this project, we do benchmark study among different classifiers and find the BERT model as the best classifier. We also explain the significance of data augmentation.
